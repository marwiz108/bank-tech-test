# Bank Tech Test

The goal is to create a Bank program that allows the user (account holder) to make basic bank transactions such as deposits and withdrawals. The user should also be able to print a bank statement and see their transaction history. The data of transactions should be kept in memory; it does not need to be stored in a database.

This program is written in Ruby language, using OOD and TDD.

## Criteria

__Given__ a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
__And__ a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
__And__ a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
__When__ she prints her bank statement  
__Then__ she would see  

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

## Notes

Initially, I drew out my Domain Model to include three classes; Account, Balance, and Transactions. The starting balance attribute in the Account class would have been extracted from the Balance class, which would have the balance attribute. Additionally, the ```.deposit(amount)``` and ```.withdraw(amount)``` methods would only display the results, which are to be calculated in the Balance class with ```.add(amount)``` and ```.deduct(amount)``` methods. However, this involved using doubles/mocks. Considering I have not fully grasped how to use doubles/mocks, I decided to remove the Balance class in order to be able to complete the challenge without taking too much time.

The final tests to test whether a statement was printing I did not manage to figure out how to write the test to show that the output is a table. I also did not manage to get a test to show whether some strings or code is included in the table. However the table works when run in the terminal, as shown below.

## Terminal Table

2.5.0 :003 > a.deposit(200)
 => 200
2.5.0 :004 > a.withdraw(300)
